react is a good liberiry . we get the  attachment with the react liberiry.
       react-dom
     ↗
react 
     ↘
      reacct-native

;;   react  [   when we want to work on website then we use react-dom.]
;;         [ if  we want to work on Moblie app then we use react-native.]

The first & basic method to make react is ( npx create-react-app 01basicreact ). 

;; when i create-react-app then we face the ENOENT problem then we use the commond on vs terminol
;;  (npm install -g create-react-app) after it enter this commond (npx create-react-app foldername)

This commond (npx create-react-app foldername) take time to installing package. so then we wait for complete it.

Vite is also a liberiry like other liberiry .

To make Vite file we use this (npm create vite@latest)

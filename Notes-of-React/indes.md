react is a good liberiry . we get the  attachment with the react liberiry.
       react-dom
     ↗
react 
     ↘
      reacct-native

;;   react  [   when we want to work on website then we use react-dom.]
;;         [ if  we want to work on Moblie app then we use react-native.]

The first & basic method to make react is ( npx create-react-app 01basicreact ). 

;; when i create-react-app then we face the ENOENT problem then we use the commond on vs terminol
;;  (npm install -g create-react-app) after it enter this commond (npx create-react-app foldername)

This commond (npx create-react-app foldername) take time to installing package. so then we wait for complete it.

Vite is also a liberiry like other liberiry .

To make Vite file we use this (npm create vite@latest)


;; Highligts about 1st lecture 
First lecture we learn here is  {
    Make basic react 
    how to create project 
    how to clean project
    how to make folder with react liberiry in vs terminal.
    how to make folder with Vite liberiry in vs terminal.
    how to run those file 
}

;; Highligts

;; 2nd lecture we learn components

which function we import it componenet

when ever we use react or vite we need to make capital first letter of it name  convension (function names).


;;  *************************************** Highlights of Main.jsx lectures  **********************************8888
//  (1)
//  we see that if App.jsx is just a method then we write method we make it 

import React from 'react'
import ReactDom from 'react-dom/client'
// there is one other thing in react.jsx call directly
import {jsx as _jsx} from "reac/jsx_runtime.js"
import App from './App.jsx'
//  (3)
// then we know if worked like these trees structure object banati ha

function Myapp(){
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Custom App !</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
// (4)
// then we make a tree method but it can't work

// (6)
// so then why our element doesn't work why our element does. work whats the fault in it?
// const ReactElement = {
//   hamza: 'a',
//   props: {
//       href:'https://Google.com',
//       target: '_blank'
//   },
//   children:'Click me to visit google'
// }
// (7) upper code
// then we availuate that our element is good  that propety, keys, value use in it we make by our heart that why they don't work 

// (5)
// then we see if i give them like this below element and give then proper html element and it's working


const anotherElement = (
  <a href="https://google.com" target='_blank'>Visit google</a>
)


const anotherUser = "Chai aur react"

// (8)
// then we use the React.createElement that is by default (automatically) injected 
//  Who injected it?  Bubble injecte it.

const ReactElement = React.createElement(
  'a', //firs give them element 
  {href: 'https://google.com', target: '_blank'}, // give them input values
  'click me to visit google',// then 3rd value. evaluateted experssion wher we injecte our variables
  anotherElement 
)



//  (.2)
// then we how to excute redirectly that methood

ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  // we done it without parentesis
  ReactElement
)


;; ************************************* Hightligtes of Custom-react/customreac.js file ********************************************

// ===========  Here we make own react element( 1) =====

function customRendor(reactElement, container){


    // (.4) 
    // then we use basic approch method like setAttributes 
    // aftertthat we realize this is not modiler approch, here code repeat then we use another method (5)

    // const domElement = document.createElement(reactElement.type);
    // domElement.innerHTML = reactElement.children
    // domElement.setAttribute('href', reactElement.props.href);
    // domElement.setAttribute('target', reactElement.props.target);

    // Container.appendChild(domElement);

    // (.5)
    // then we use this method  and set loops in it 

    const domElement = document.createElement(reactElement.type)
    domElement.innerHTML = reactElement.children
    for (const prop in reactElement.props) {
        if (prop === 'children') continue;
        domElement.setAttribute(prop, reactElement.props[prop])
    }
    container.appendChild(domElement);
}
// (.6)
// these are our custom render method 


// (.3)
// then we wana know how to create react object  then we create by our self 

// (.7)
// we expect that when ever we pass any syntax then send below syntax 
// then we go main.jsx 

const reactElement = {
    type: 'a',
    props: {
        href:'https://Google.com',
        target: '_blank'
    },
    children:'Click me to visit google'
}
// (.2)
// firstly we get root element by useing queryselcetor 
// then we need  render mehod that get my element and inject them in a container

const mainContainer = document.querySelector('#root')

customRendor(reactElement, mainContainer)


;; ********************* React hooks and  Project *******************8
 
 In this lecture we learn about hooks and Project 
 Make  a project that is how to add value and remove value
 by button element and using onclick method .
 after that we done the assignment which is about value stop when they equal to 20 and stop when equal to 0.
 this is helpfull for us . 
 The code is below. or  you can see the code in 02vitereact folder/ App.jsx file.


 This is the code.....

;; The useState is called the hooks there is many kind of hooks like setcounter,  setmemo, like this.
 import { useState } from 'react'

import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'
import viteLogo from '/vite.svg'
import './App.css'

function App() {
  ;;  here is also use hooks {setCounter}
  let [counter, setCounter] = useState(15)


  // let counter = 15;

   const addValue = () => {
      // counter = counter + 1;
      setCounter(counter + 1)
      // this if statement we create as a assignment
      if (counter === 20) {
        setCounter(counter => 15)
      }
  }


  const remoevalue = () => {
    setCounter(counter - 1)
    // this if statement we create as a assignment 
    if (counter === 0) {
      setCounter(counter => 15)
    }
  }
 

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hamza Choudary</h1>
      <h3>Vite value: {counter}</h3>


      <button onClick={addValue}>Add Value {counter}</button>
       <br />
      <button onClick={remoevalue}>Remove Value {counter}</button>
      <p>footer {counter}</p>
    </>
  )
}

export default App


;; ****************** In this lecture we learn about Virtual Dom & React fiber *******************

;;  This lectrue important for interview,

We learn about in this lecture {reconciliation, Virtual Dom, latest approch about Fiber,}


if we wana see the React Fiber then we need to go this below link [
 ;; https://github.com/acdlite/react-fiber-architecture
]

;; reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed. ;; [Here is the two trees is One of them Browers tree and second Reac tree Which come from createroot element].


;; The keys points are:
In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
Different types of updates have different priorities — an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.
A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.

;; What is a fiber?
We're about to discuss the heart of React Fiber's architecture. Fibers are a much lower-level abstraction than application developers typically think about. If you find yourself frustrated in your attempts to understand it, don't feel discouraged. Keep trying and it will eventually make sense. (When you do finally get it, please suggest how to improve this section.)

;; ****************** Tailwind and props in reactjs ************

;; we learn here
 Tailwind , components and get components card, pass value in components default values.
 If you want to more details about this lecture then go to 
;;  {0tailwindprops folder} 

and read more about there.

;; ********* Now we learn about interview question on counter *********



;;  *************** Foundation is complete almost ⬆ **************

;; Now we start the Projects


;;  ************ we done here BGChanger Project ************

When we click on the color button then background color change 
that put on the button.

;; ******************* 05 Password Generator ************

The hooks we use here UseEffect, useRef, useCallback.

In this lecture we are done here password generator program with react (vite) 
we add in it range of length, numbers , Character.

;; ******************* 06 Custom hooks in react **********8
;; (Currency converter)

which task we done in project

learn custom hooks
how to call api 
how to setup project,
how to creating components.
how to approach for exporting components.
useId hook.
state setup
